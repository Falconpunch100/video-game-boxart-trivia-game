    <header>Welcome to the Video Game Cover Trivia game!<br>
        Test your knowledge on gaming by guessing the name of the game based on the cover's art. Some games will be easy to guess, but others are much more obscure and will be challenging to know to even to veteran players.<br>
        Your score will be calculated by how close you came to the correct answer. A symbol will be put below your answer once you submit your answers.<br>
        -A <span class="right">✔</span> symbol means your answer was correct, and you will be scored 1 point in your tally.<br>
        -A <span class="closeEnough">━</span> symbol means your answer was close enough to be considered correct, but it wasn't 100% accurate. You will be scored 0.5 on your tally.<br>
        -A <span class="wrong">✖</span> symbol means your answer was wrong, and you will receive no points on your tally.<br>
        Can you get a perfect score? Good luck! (you're gonna need it)
